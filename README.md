# Monitoring-the-depth-of-anaesthesia-using-variation-mode-decomposition
This study combined a non-recursive signal decomposition technique known as Variation Mode Decomposition (VMD) with Permutation Entropy (PE), Petrosian Fractal Dimension (PFD) and Lempel-Ziv Complexity (LCZ) to build a novel machine learning index that would effectively monitor the depth of Anaesthesia (DoA). 

Correct administration of anaesthesia is important during any surgical procedures. Bispectral index (BIS), which ranges from 0 to 100 is used to monitor the level of anaesthesia as it reflects the level of consciousness with 0 indicating deep anaesthesia and 100 indicating that the patient is fully awake.

The techniques combined in this study is novel for designing model to monitor DoA.

The following steps are followed in this study:
1. Data Collection
2. Sample selection
3. Data cleaning
4. Window Segmentation
5. Signal decomposition
6. Feature extraction
7. Feature Selection
8. Model Building
9. Evaluation
10. Results and discussion
